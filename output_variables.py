#there are many ways to output a variable
a=5
b="hello"
#print(a+b) this will return an error cause a is int and b is string . 

#if we want to print them together we can use
print(a,b)

x=5
y=10
print(x+y) #this is the mathematical operation 

x="hello"
y="world"
print(x+y) #this is called concatenation

#we can also print two strings together without a '+'
print(x,y) 

#now look at the spacing in the two outputs.
#when using '+' there is no space we have to give space in the string itself
#when usign ',' there is space automatically without giving in the string.
